🏦 Bank Loan Approval System
This project implements a machine learning system to predict bank loan approvals. It uses various classification algorithms to determine whether a loan should be approved based on a series of applicant features.

Features 📊
The project includes:

Data loading and exploration with Pandas.
Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Data visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Modeling and evaluation using different classification algorithms.
An ensemble of models for improved predictions.
Saving and loading trained models using pickle.
